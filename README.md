# Student Portal using Java

This Java project is a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) for the Student Portal. The application serves multiple purposes, including user authentication, course management, and new user registration. Developed using Java and Swing for the front-end, and Microsoft Access Database for the back-end, this project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both students and administrators.
